# Recycling Detection App

This application uses TensorFlow.js for object detection to identify recyclable items and Codehooks.io for backend services.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js
- Data storage and management with Codehooks.io
- Real-time notifications for important events
- Model training and improvement using user feedback
- Analytics for tracking user interactions and application performance

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_API_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
VITE_CODEHOOKS_API_KEY=your_codehooks_api_key
VITE_CODEHOOKS_APP_ID=your_codehooks_app_id
VITE_CODEHOOKS_APP_URL=your_codehooks_app_url
```

4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Codehooks.io Integration

This application uses Codehooks.io for various backend services:

- Data Storage: User information, training data, and detection results are stored using Codehooks.io.
- Real-Time Notifications: Users receive notifications based on specific events or actions.
- Model Training: Training data is uploaded to Codehooks.io, and model training jobs are managed through the platform.
- Feedback Loop: User feedback on detection results is collected and used to improve the model.
- Analytics: User interactions and application performance are tracked and analyzed using Codehooks.io.
